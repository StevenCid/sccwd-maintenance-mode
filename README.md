# sccwd-maintenance-mode
Lightweight WordPress plugin to put the frontend into maintenance mode for non-admin accounts.
Intended to make updating the frontend easier if you don't have a staging site to test updates.
Note if you break WP core or generate a fatal error on the frontend firing sequence, this plugin will not function.
Feel free to fork and customize to your needs.
